# Pacman-Factory
## Description 
This program generates Pacman shapes which move across the screen. The user generates figures by clicking a button and then disperses them in many directions by starting the game. 
## How to Run
To use this program, download index.html, pacman factory.js, and the 4 Pacman PNG images into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser. 
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Pacmen figures should change direction to face the way they move.
